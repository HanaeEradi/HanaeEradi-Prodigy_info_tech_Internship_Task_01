# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression


This project implements a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on key features, including square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The goal is to train the model to predict the price of a house given these input features, using a dataset containing information about various properties. The model was built using Python and its popular data science libraries, such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn. Key steps in the project include data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling features), splitting the data into training and testing sets, and evaluating the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2).
